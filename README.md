# project 1: Nightmare Analysis in Kids.

# Sleep Patterns and Psychological Problems Analysis

## üìå Project Description
This project explores the relationship between sleep patterns, nightmares, recent life changes, and psychological problems at school among students. Using a real-life dataset, we analyze average psychological problem scores across different groups and investigate whether these factors show meaningful patterns.

## üéØ Objectives
- To examine the impact of nightmare frequency on psychological problems at school.
- To explore the effect of recent life changes on psychological well-being.
- To determine whether irregular sleep patterns are associated with higher psychological problem scores.
- To draw data-driven insights that could inform interventions for students.

## üõ† Tools and Libraries Used

- **Matplotlib** ‚Äì Data visualization
- **Seaborn** ‚Äì Enhanced data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Interactive analysis environment

# üí° Insights & Reflections
Nightmare frequency, recent life changes, and irregular sleep patterns all showed minimal differences in average psychological problem scores.

The observed differences were less than 0.3 points, suggesting no strong direct association in this dataset.

Further analysis (e.g., statistical significance tests) is recommended to confirm whether these small differences are meaningful.

Other unmeasured factors might have a greater influence on psychological well-being, such as academic pressure, social support, or physical health.
